# Creating My Own Private Blockchain

Create a test application that allows the user to register stars, and track the ownership of each.

## What steps are needed to implement this application?

1.- The application will create a Genesis Block when we run the application.

2.- The user will request the application to send a message to be signed using a Wallet and in this way verify the ownership over the wallet address. The message format will be:

<code><WALLET_ADRESS>:${new Date().getTime().toString().slice(0,-3)}:starRegistry</code>

3.- Once the user has the message they can use a Wallet (Electrum or Bitcoin Core for example) to sign the message.

4.- The user will try to submit the Star object for that. The submission will consist of: <code>wallet address</code>, <code>message</code>, <code>signature</code> and the <code>star</code> object with the star information. The Start information will be formed in this format:

<pre>
<code>
     "star": {
         "dec": "68Â° 52' 56.9",
         "ra": "16h 29m 1.0s",
         "story": "Testing the story 4"
     }
</code>
</pre>

5.- The application will verify if the time elapsed from the request ownership (the time is contained in the message) and the time when you submit the star is less than 5 minutes.

6.- If everything is okay the star information will be stored in the block and added to the chain encoding the Star information.

7.- The application will allow us to retrieve the Star objects belong to an owner (wallet address). This information should be human readable so it shouldn't be encoded.
